      Hello! My name is Jordan! I'm from Ohio originally and moved to Salt Lake City six years ago to chase the snow, but I ended up settling down here in SLC. I am married to the love of my life and our seven month old daughter is the best thing ever!
    </p>

    <p>I began my professional life in video production, though my interest in video began when I picked up a video camera to film my friends snowboarding. Eventually I created a brand called So Far So Good, which helped me to learn video editing and videography, brand development, social media management, design, and marketing.</p>

    <p>
      Over a few years I sharpened my skills well enough to work for Go Video Go and Foursteps.io as video editor and video director, respectively. I created videos and motion graphics for companies like 97th Floor, GamerSensei and Boeing.
    </p>

    <p>
      I decided to add to my skills by learning web development through DevMountain. With Covid-19 impacting hiring across industries, I wanted to make sure I had more than one viable skill under my belt. I have since created responsive full stack web applications from the ground up, both on my own and in a remote group setting.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now as a full stack web developer I can bring design, branding, and multi media implementation skills to boost a startup or refine the web presence of already established companies.
    </p>

    <p>I look forward to working with you! </p>

    <p>Jordan</p>
