      As a DevMountain Certified Web Developer graduate, I am experienced in creating and maintaining full stack web apps from the ground up. I am proficient in Javascript, React, Node, Express, SQL and more! To add to my web development tool belt, I have years of professional experience in digital marketing and video production, motion graphics production and implementation using programs such as Final Cut Pro, Adobe After Effects and Premiere. I have been on the ground floor of tech start ups as well as on teams in established companies.         
    </p>

    <p>I began my professional life in video production, though my interest in video started early on when I picked up my dad's  video camera to make movies with my siblings. As I got older I focused my passion for video into creating snowboarding films, and eventually I created a brand called So Far So Good, which inspired me to learn video editing and videography, brand development, social media management, design, and marketing.</p>

    <p>
      Over a few years I sharpened my skills enough to work for Go Video Go and Foursteps.io as video editor and video director, respectively. While working for Foursteps.io, a financial planning startup, I rose to the video director position where I was directly responsible for creating the company's video and motion graphic content for digital marketing. While I was employed at Go Video Go I created videos and motion graphics for companies like 97th Floor, GamerSensei and Boeing.

    <p>
      I decided to add to my skills by learning web development through DevMountain. With Covid-19 impacting hiring across industries, I wanted to make sure I had more than one viable skill under my belt. I have since created responsive full stack web applications from the ground up, both on my own and in a remote group setting.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now as a full stack web developer I can bring design, branding, and multi media implementation skills to boost a startup or refine the web presence of already established companies.
    </p>

    <p>I look forward to working with you! </p>
